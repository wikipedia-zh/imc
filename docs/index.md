## Author Note

I now re-release this Instant Messaging Code, with relevant authorship reserved. It is a work that unfortunately highly under-appreciated by the Chinese Wikipedia administrative team existed before this work, which my fellows and I have not been fully able to overcome and bring a new order. The environment is still highly corrupted. It is so I chose to reserve my authorship.

At the same time, my thoughts have been again altered: institutionalism is not a solution, at least here in the Chinese Wikipedia. The defect of participants in the Chinese Wikipedia cannot significantly carry the functionality of this institutionalised system. *Guanxi* and face (*mianzi* and *lian*) carries conspicuous affects which induced the dysfunctionality and misusage of my institutional designs. I hereby express my strongest regret and condemnation to the detrimental group of people there.

Here, I also release some of my drafts at ./_drafts , for you to view my initial blueprint.

I re-released this work based on a very simple reason — I need to clean unless docs for my hard drive. Hence I asked Pepper (Borschts) and Rowe (Frederisk) whether they wished to keep the last local copy of all. They said "upload it"; so I did, with no more nostalgia for this work.

This work shall not be limited to the Chinese Wikipedia groups; it belongs to all for utilisation in group governance, or in a better word, member relationship maintenance. If Pepper (Borschts) and Rowe (Frederisk) have any suitable choice on licence or still remains non-licence, it should be respected. Yet, a moral right of mine should still be retained in case of any bad usage against general members of any group and against this hard work.

It is time to declare a farewell to my springtime of life, and to pass a goodbye to an unachieved dream to change the Chinese Wikipedia's community through this set of rules, through institutionalisation.

May you all be blessed; safe and sound.

Best Regards,
